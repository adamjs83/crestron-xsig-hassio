and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.25.4] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed
- **Memory Leak Fix** - Fixed incorrect cleanup of template trackers in `__init__.py`
  - `async_track_template_result` returns a callable, not an object with `async_remove()`
  - Changed cleanup to call the returned function directly
  - Standardized callback cleanup pattern in `sensor.py` and `media_player.py` to match other platforms

## [1.25.3] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed
- **Callback Deregistration Leaks** - Fixed memory leak where entity callbacks persisted after removal
  - Bound methods create new objects each time, so `remove_callback(self.process_callback)` never matched
  - Now stores callback reference on registration and uses same reference for removal
  - Affects: light, switch, cover, climate (2 classes), event, binary_sensor entities

- **Cover Stop Feature** - Fixed runtime errors when stop command issued without stop_join configured
  - STOP feature now only advertised when stop_join is configured
  - Guard added to `async_stop_cover()` method

- **Template Join Conversion Safety** - Fixed crashes from invalid template values
  - Analog joins now handle float strings like "1.0" via `int(float(value))`
  - Invalid values logged as warnings instead of crashing connection

- **XSIG Server Shutdown** - Fixed incomplete cleanup leaving sockets in limbo
  - Now properly awaits `wait_closed()` for both server and writer
  - Writer drained before closing

- **Digital Value Parsing** - Expanded truthy/falsy value recognition
  - Now accepts: "1", "0", "true", "false", "yes", "no" (case-insensitive)
  - In addition to existing: STATE_ON, STATE_OFF, "True", "False"

- **LED Binding Entity ID Matching** - Fixed bindings silently failing for names with special characters
  - Now uses Home Assistant's `slugify()` helper instead of naive `.lower().replace(" ", "_")`
  - Handles punctuation, hyphens, unicode, and other special characters correctly

- **Missing Translations** - Synced translations/en.json with strings.json
  - Added: `edit_dimmer`, `led_binding_menu`, `configure_dimmer_leds` steps
  - Added: `abort` section for dimmer-related errors

## [1.25.2] - 2025-11-25

### Removed
- **Dead Code Cleanup** - Removed ~230 lines of unused code
  - Removed deprecated LED binding class and unreachable code from select.py (218 lines)
  - Removed 12 unused imports from __init__.py
  - Removed unused imports from 8 platform files (light, binary_sensor, sensor, switch, media_player, climate, event, led_binding_manager)
  - No functional changes - code cleanup only

## [1.25.1] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed
- **Auto-cleanup Deprecated LED Binding Entities** - Removes orphaned LED binding select entities
  - These entities stored ALL bindable HA entities as options, exceeding 16KB database limit
  - Now automatically cleaned up on integration reload
  - Fixes "State attributes exceed maximum size of 16384 bytes" warnings

## [1.25.0] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed
- **Manual Join Lookup for Dimmers** - Fixed LED switches and button events not using manual join configuration
  - JSON serialization converts dict keys from integers to strings
  - Manual joins lookup now uses string keys (`str(button_num)`)
  - Affected files: switch.py, event.py, config_flow/dimmers.py
  - LED feedback switches now correctly use configured manual joins instead of auto-sequential calculation

## [1.24.9] - 2025-01-25

### Changed
- **Centralized Hub Access** - Created `helpers.py` with `get_hub()` function
  - Removed 75 lines of duplicate hub access code across 9 platform files
  - Consistent hub lookup pattern: config entry first, YAML fallback
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code

## [1.24.8] - 2025-01-25

### Fixed
- **Import Error Fix** - Removed incorrect `from .hub import CrestronHub` in sensor.py and switch.py
  - The `CrestronHub` class is in `__init__.py`, not a separate hub module
  - Changed type hints to use `Any` instead

## [1.24.7] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- **Comprehensive Type Hints** - Added type hints to all 27 Python files
  - Modern Python 3.10+ syntax (`|` for unions, `list[]` instead of `List[]`)
  - All function parameters and return types annotated
  - Class attributes typed for better IDE support
  - Complex local variables typed for clarity
  - Home Assistant types properly imported (HomeAssistant, ConfigEntry, FlowResult, etc.)
  - Improved code maintainability and IDE autocomplete support

## [1.24.6] - 2025-01-24

### Changed
- **Centralized Version Constant** - Added `VERSION` constant to `const.py`
  - All `sw_version` references now use the centralized constant
  - Single source of truth for version number
  - Updated 9 `device_info` properties across 8 files
  - Device info now shows correct version (was showing outdated 1.6.0/1.8.0)

## [1.24.5] - 2025-01-24

### Changed
- **Specific Exception Handling** - Replaced broad `except Exception` with `except OSError`
  - Socket operations now catch only network-related errors
  - Programming errors (TypeError, ValueError) will now propagate instead of being silently caught
  - Updated 6 exception handlers in `crestron.py`

## [1.24.4] - 2025-01-24

### Changed
- **Logging Performance** - Converted f-string logging to %-style formatting
  - Defers string interpolation until message is actually logged
  - Minor performance improvement when debug logging is disabled
  - Updated 27 log statements across 10 files

## [1.24.3] - 2025-01-24

### Changed
- **Template Sync Performance** - O(1) lookup for template-to-join mapping
  - Added `_template_to_join` reverse lookup dictionary
  - `template_change_callback` now uses dict lookup instead of iterating through all templates
  - Improves performance when Home Assistant state changes trigger Crestron updates
  - With 100 templates: reduced from 100 comparisons to 1 lookup per state change

## [1.24.2] - 2025-01-24

### Added
- **`async_set_analog` Method** - New async method for sending analog joins with proper flow control
  - Awaits `drain()` to ensure data is transmitted before returning
  - Prevents potential buffer issues during rapid analog value updates
  - Consistent with existing `async_set_digital` pattern

### Changed
- Updated all platform files to use `async_set_analog` instead of sync `set_analog`:
  - `light.py` - brightness control
  - `cover.py` - position control
  - `climate.py` - temperature setpoints and floor warming mode
  - `media_player.py` - volume and source selection
  - `__init__.py` - template sync to hub

## [1.24.1] - 2025-01-24

### Fixed
- **Code Cleanup** - Removed duplicate definitions
  - Removed duplicate `EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STOP` import in `__init__.py`
  - Removed duplicate `CONF_STOP_JOIN` constant in `const.py` (shared by covers and media players)

## [1.24.0] - 2025-01-24

### Changed
- **Major Performance Improvement** - Entity callbacks now filter by relevant joins
  - Each entity only updates when its specific join(s) change, not on every join change
  - With 50 entities and 10 updates/sec: reduced from 500 to 10 state updates/sec (50x improvement)
  - All entities still respond to connection state changes ("available" callback)
  - No impact on startup behavior - entities receive updates when Crestron sends their joins
  - Affected platforms: light, switch, sensor, binary_sensor, cover, climate, media_player
  - Event entities already had correct filtering (unchanged)

## [1.23.1] - 2025-01-24

### Fixed
- **Config Entry Removal Bug** - Fixed issue where deleting a config entry prevented adding a new entry on the same port
  - Implemented `async_remove_entry()` for proper cleanup when entries are deleted
  - Hub now properly stops and releases port when entry is removed
  - Entry data cleaned from `hass.data[DOMAIN]` on removal
  - Hub_source markers and notification flags cleared appropriately
  - Maintains hub persistence during reload (no connection drops when managing entities)

## [1.23.0] - 2025-01-22

### Added
- **Event Bus Integration for Button Presses** - Buttons now fire `crestron_button` events
  - Event type: `crestron_button`
  - Event data: `device_name`, `button` (1-6), `action` (press/double_press/hold)
  - Works with standard Home Assistant event triggers
  - Compatible with Node-RED and other automation tools
  - EventEntity state updates still work (backward compatible)

### Changed
- Button events now fire on both EventEntity (entity state) AND event bus
- Enables simpler automation creation without blueprints
- Event data structure consistent across all button events

### Example Automation
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: crestron_button
    event_data:
      device_name: "Living Room Dimmer"
      button: 1
      action: press
action:
  - service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

## [1.22.7] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- **LED Binding Edit with Unbound Buttons** - Fixed crash when editing LED bindings with empty buttons
  - Root cause: Unbound buttons stored as `None`, but code expected dict
  - Line 138: `existing_bindings.get(str(btn_num), {})` returned stored `None`, not default `{}`
  - Line 162: Tried to call `.get("invert")` on `None` → AttributeError
  - Solution: Use `or {}` to ensure `existing` is always a dict
  - Now you can edit LED bindings even when some buttons are unbound

## [1.22.6] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- **Dimmer Edit Preserves LED Bindings** - Fixed critical data loss bug when editing dimmers
  - Root cause: Dimmer handler used stale config_entry.data, wiping out LED bindings on save
  - Solution: Get fresh entry before all dimmer save operations (consistent with LED binding handler)
  - Now LED bindings survive: editing dimmers, adding dimmers, removing dimmers
  - Fixed all 4 save locations: add_dimmer_simple, add_dimmer_manual, _save_dimmer, remove_dimmers
  - Same pattern that fixed LED binding persistence in v1.22.5

### Changed
- Dimmer handler now uses fresh config entry pattern: `async_get_entry(entry_id)` before `async_update_entry()`
- Consistent with LED binding handler and other entity handlers (covers, lights, sensors, etc.)

## [1.22.5] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- **LED Bindings Finally Persist!** - Found and fixed the ACTUAL root cause via agent analysis
  - Root cause: In OptionsFlow, `async_create_entry(data={})` sets options to empty dict
  - Was saving to entry.options then immediately overwriting with async_create_entry(data={})
  - Solution: Move LED bindings from entry.options to entry.data (consistent with other handlers)
  - Now bindings persist across: reopening config, integration reload, HA restart
  - Agent ran deep analysis 3x to identify the Home Assistant options flow pattern issue

### Changed
- LED bindings now stored in `config_entry.data[CONF_LED_BINDINGS]` (not options)
- Consistent with covers, lights, switches, sensors, climate, media players, dimmers

## [1.22.4] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- **LED Bindings Not Saved to Storage** - Fixed the critical root cause preventing any persistence
  - Root cause: Config flow updated a stale config_entry that HA didn't persist
  - Solution: Always get fresh entry from registry before saving and loading bindings
  - Now bindings are actually written to storage and survive restarts
  - Symptoms fixed:
    - Bindings appeared to work but selections were gone when reopening config
    - Bindings lost after integration reload
    - Bindings lost after HA restart

## [1.22.3] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- **LED Bindings Lost After Integration Reload** - Fixed the actual root cause
  - Root cause: LED binding manager stored stale config_entry in __init__ and reused it during reload
  - Solution: Store entry_id and always get fresh entry from registry in _load_bindings()
  - Now bindings persist correctly when you reload the integration via UI
  - User workflow now works: Configure bindings → they work → reload integration → they STILL work

## [1.22.2] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- **LED Bindings Lost After Reload** - Fixed bindings disappearing after integration reload
  - Root cause: Stale config entry object during reload didn't have updated options
  - Solution: Get fresh entry from config entries registry before initializing LED binding manager
  - Bindings now persist correctly across integration reloads
  - No more "LED binding manager initialized with 0 bindings" after reload

## [1.22.1] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **LED Binding Validation Error** - Fixed "Entity None is neither a valid entity ID" error when leaving button LED bindings blank
  - Root cause: EntitySelector with `default=None` caused validation error
  - Solution: Only set default value when there's an actual existing entity_id
  - Now properly allows optional/unbound buttons as designed

## [1.22.0] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **LED Binding Manager** - Domain-filtered LED binding solution with zero database bloat
  - Store LED bindings in config entry options instead of select entities (avoids 32KB limit)
  - Domain-filtered entity selectors show only 15-50 relevant entities (vs 300+)
  - Config flow UI: Settings → Crestron → Configure → Manage Dimmers/Keypads → Configure LED Bindings
  - Automatic state synchronization via state listeners
  - Support for invert flag (LED on when entity is off)
  - Reload support without connection drops
  - Persistent across Home Assistant restart

### Changed
- LED bindings now stored in `config_entry.options["led_bindings"]` (JSON format)
- Select entities for LED binding deprecated (will be removed in future release)
- Improved performance with O(1) lookups and direct callbacks

### Technical Details
- Created `led_binding_manager.py` - Core LED sync logic with automatic state listeners
- Created `config_flow/led_bindings.py` - UI flow handler for LED configuration
- Updated `__init__.py` - Register and initialize LED binding manager
- Updated config flow menus to add LED binding configuration option
- Supports all bindable domains: light, switch, cover, binary_sensor, climate, media_player, and more

## [1.21.1] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed
- **Blueprint Template Error** - Fixed "Entity {{ button_1_event }} is neither a valid entity ID" error
  - Root cause: Templates not supported in trigger entity_id fields
  - Solution: Added back button event entity selectors with smart device filtering
  - Entity selectors now auto-filter to show only buttons from selected dimmer device
  - UX improvement: Select device once, then button dropdowns only show that device's buttons

### Changed
- Button entity selectors are now optional with smart filtering
- Each button selector automatically filters to show only event entities from the selected dimmer device
- Maintains the improved UX while fixing the template validation error

## [1.21.0] - 2025-11-21 [BROKEN - DO NOT USE]

### Changed
- **Blueprint Major UX Overhaul: Complete Auto-Discovery**
  - **Select dimmer device ONCE** - everything else is automatic
  - Button event entities auto-discovered from device (no manual selection needed!)
  - LED switch entities auto-discovered from device
  - User only configures actions and LED bindings (optional)
  - Removed 6 redundant button entity selectors

### Before vs After
**Before (v1.20.9):**
- Select dimmer device
- Select button 1 event entity
- Select button 2 event entity
- ... (6 selections)
- Configure actions
- Select LED bindings

**After (v1.21.0):**
- Select dimmer device ✨ **THAT'S IT!**
- Configure actions (optional)
- Select LED bindings (optional)

### Technical Details
- Auto-discovers button event entities using `device_entities()` with regex matching
- Auto-discovers LED switch entities from same device
- Triggers use template variables instead of user inputs
- Cleaner, more intuitive configuration experience

### Benefits
- **80% fewer manual selections** (1 device vs 7 entities)
- Impossible to mismatch button entities with wrong device
- Faster setup for new dimmers
- More user-friendly for non-technical users

## [1.20.9] - 2025-11-21 [SUPERSEDED]

### Changed
- **Blueprint UX Improvement: Device Selector**
  - Replaced manual text input for dimmer name with device selector dropdown
  - Automatically derives LED switch entity IDs from selected device
  - No more typing errors or mismatches between dimmer name and entity IDs
  - Uses Home Assistant's native device picker with filtering

### Technical Details
- Blueprint now uses `device_entities()` to dynamically discover LED switches
- Device filter ensures only Crestron Keypad/Dimmer devices are shown
- LED entity IDs are automatically matched using regex patterns

## [1.20.8] - 2025-11-21

### Changed (Breaking)
- **LED Binding Moved to Blueprint**
  - LED binding is now configured directly in the blueprint automation
  - Select entities for LED binding (`select.{dimmer}_button_{n}_led_binding`) are deprecated and no longer created
  - Existing users: Reconfigure LED bindings in the blueprint (one-time setup required)
  - All other dimmer functionality unchanged: event entities, LED switches, lighting load, device grouping

### Fixed
- **Recorder Database Errors** - Eliminated 32KB `entity_registry_updated` errors
  - Previous implementation stored all bindable entities in select entity options
  - With 300+ entities, this exceeded Home Assistant's 32KB database limit
  - New blueprint approach uses native HA entity picker with no database storage

### Benefits
- Better UX: Native Home Assistant entity picker with built-in search
- No entity proliferation: Removes 6 select entities per dimmer
- Simpler integration: LED binding logic in one place (blueprint)
- More maintainable: ~200 lines of code removed from integration

### Migration Guide
**For existing users with LED bindings configured:**
1. Open your dimmer blueprint automation in Home Assistant
2. In the blueprint inputs, re-select the entities you want bound to each LED
3. Save the automation
4. Old select entities will no longer be created and can be safely deleted

**Example:**
- Before: Set `select.kitchen_keypad_button_1_led_binding` to `light.kitchen`
- After: Set blueprint input `Button 1 - LED Binding` to `light.kitchen`

## [1.20.7] - 2025-11-21

### Changed
- **Join Limits Increased to Protocol Maximum**
  - Digital joins: d1-d250 → **d1-d4096** (protocol supports 12-bit encoding = 4096 joins)
  - Analog joins: a1-a250 → **a1-a1024** (protocol supports 10-bit encoding = 1024 joins)
  - Serial joins: s1-s250 → **s1-s1024** (protocol supports 10-bit encoding = 1024 joins)
  - Previous 250 limit was artificially restrictive
  - Crestron systems support thousands of joins as designed
  - Updated validation in `config_flow/dimmers.py` and error messages in `strings.json` and `translations/en.json`

## [1.20.6] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **Config Flow: Dimmer Edit Menu** - Fixed blank menu options when editing dimmers
  - Issue: When selecting a dimmer to edit, two blank options with right-facing arrows were displayed
  - Clicking either option resulted in an error
  - Root cause: `async_step_edit_dimmer` used `async_show_menu()` without proper strings.json translations
  - Solution: Changed to `async_show_form()` with schema that defines labeled options directly
  - Now displays proper labels: "Reconfigure Dimmer/Keypad" and "← Back"
  - Consistent with all other menus in the codebase

## [1.20.5] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Automation Blueprint for Dimmer/Keypad Button Controller**
  - Pre-built blueprint for easy dimmer/keypad configuration without writing YAML
  - Configure actions for all button press types (press, double press, hold)
  - Optional LED binding for visual feedback per button
  - Support for up to 6 buttons per dimmer
  - All buttons and actions are optional - configure only what you need
  - Parallel execution mode supports multiple button presses simultaneously
  - Comprehensive documentation with examples in `blueprints/README.md`
  - One-click import from Home Assistant UI

### Documentation
- Added Blueprints section to main README with quick start guide
- Added detailed blueprint usage guide in `blueprints/README.md`
- Added example configurations for common use cases
- Added import badge for easy blueprint installation

### Files Added
- `blueprints/automation/crestron_dimmer_button_controller.yaml` - Main blueprint file
- `blueprints/README.md` - Blueprint documentation and examples

## [1.20.4] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Multi-Hub Support for Dimmer Entities** - Fixed button events and LED binding with multiple Crestron hub instances
  - Fixed: Button event entities registered callbacks on wrong hub when multiple config entries exist
  - Fixed: LED binding select entities connected to wrong hub in multi-hub configurations
  - Root cause: event.py and select.py used global hub reference instead of config entry-specific hub
  - Changed: Both files now correctly retrieve hub from `hass.data[DOMAIN][entry.entry_id]`
  - Result: Button press events and LED binding now work correctly with multiple hubs on different ports
  - Removed temporary debug logging added in v1.20.3 (no longer needed)

### Technical Details
- **Problem:** When running multiple Crestron hub instances (e.g., port 16384 and port 26475):
  - event.py line 36: `hub = hass.data[DOMAIN][HUB]` always grabbed global hub
  - select.py line 33: Same issue
  - Button events registered on wrong hub, never received callbacks from correct hub
- **Solution:** Match pattern used in other platforms (light.py, switch.py, etc.):
  - Get hub from config entry: `hass.data[DOMAIN].get(config_entry.entry_id)`
  - Handle dict format and direct reference fallback
  - Only use global HUB as last resort for backward compatibility
- **Impact:** Fixes button press detection and LED binding for dimmer/keypad entities in multi-hub setups

## [1.20.3] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Event Entity Diagnostics** - Added debug logging for button event entities
  - Event entities now log all incoming digital join callbacks when debug logging enabled
  - Helps troubleshoot button press detection issues
  - Shows what joins are being received vs. what the entity is monitoring
  - Filters to digital joins only to reduce log spam
  - Enable with: `custom_components.crestron.event: debug` in logger config

### Technical Details
- Added temporary diagnostic logging to `process_callback()` in event.py
- Logs format: "Button X received callback: dY = Z (monitoring: dA, dB, dC)"
- Only logs digital joins (d*) to avoid flooding logs with analog/serial data
- Useful for debugging Crestron-to-HA button press communication

## [1.20.2] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **Critical Import Error** - Fixed incorrect CONF_NAME import in dimmers.py
  - Fixed: Integration failed to load with "cannot import name 'CONF_NAME' from 'custom_components.crestron.const'"
  - Root cause: dimmers.py was importing CONF_NAME from custom const module instead of homeassistant.const
  - Changed: `from ..const import CONF_NAME` → `from homeassistant.const import CONF_NAME`
  - Result: Config flow now loads successfully, integration initializes properly

### Technical Details
- **Problem:** CONF_NAME is a Home Assistant built-in constant, not a custom Crestron constant
- All other config_flow files correctly imported CONF_NAME from homeassistant.const
- Only dimmers.py had incorrect import from ..const
- This prevented entire integration from loading during startup
- Fixed by moving CONF_NAME import to proper homeassistant.const source

## [1.20.1] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **Integration Setup Failure** - Completed config_flow refactoring to fix initialization errors
  - Fixed: Integration failed to load with `KeyError: 'crestron'` in all platforms
  - Root cause: CrestronConfigFlow and OptionsFlowHandler were not exported from config_flow package
  - Moved flow classes from standalone config_flow.py to config_flow/flow.py module
  - Updated config_flow/__init__.py to properly export CrestronConfigFlow and OptionsFlowHandler
  - Fixed circular import issues in OptionsFlowHandler initialization

### Technical Details
- **Problem:** v1.20.0 created config_flow/ package but left main classes in config_flow.py
- Python's import resolution prioritizes packages over modules
- Home Assistant couldn't find CrestronConfigFlow class → integration never initialized
- All platforms failed because `hass.data[DOMAIN]` was never created
- **Solution:** Completed the refactoring by moving all flow logic into the package
- Created config_flow/flow.py (338 lines) with CrestronConfigFlow and OptionsFlowHandler
- Updated imports to use relative package imports (.menus, .joins, etc.)
- Deleted old standalone config_flow.py file

## [1.20.0] - 2025-01-21

### Changed
- **Major Code Refactoring** - Restructured config_flow.py for improved maintainability
  - Split monolithic 3,457-line config_flow.py into 16 modular files
  - Main config_flow.py reduced to 426 lines (87.6% reduction)
  - Created dedicated handler classes for validators, menus, joins, dimmers, and entities
  - Each platform (cover, light, switch, sensor, etc.) now has its own handler module
  - No user-facing changes - purely internal code organization improvements

### Technical Details
- **New structure:** `config_flow/` directory with modular handlers
  - `validators.py` - Port validation and exception classes
  - `base.py` - BaseOptionsFlow and helper utilities
  - `menus.py` - Navigation menu handlers (293 lines)
  - `joins.py` - Join sync configuration handlers (376 lines)
  - `dimmers.py` - Dimmer/keypad wizard handlers (988 lines)
  - `entities/` - Individual platform handlers (8 files, 1,883 lines total)
- **Benefits:** Improved code navigation, reduced merge conflicts, better testability
- **Pattern:** Handler delegation with `self.flow` references
- All 16 files validated with Python syntax checking
- Zero functional changes - pure refactoring for maintainability

## [1.19.3] - 2025-01-20

### Changed
- **LED Binding Diagnostics** - Enhanced logging for LED binding troubleshooting
  - Added detailed logging when bindings are configured
  - Increased sync logging to INFO level with full service call details
  - Added error handling and logging for switch service calls
  - Logs now show LED entity_id, bound entity state, and service call results

### Technical Details
- Updated `select.py` _sync_led_state() with comprehensive logging
- Added try/except around service calls to catch and log errors
- Helps diagnose LED binding issues where physical LEDs don't respond to bound entity changes

## [1.19.2] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- **LED Switch Entities** - Fixed creation of LED switches from dimmer configurations
  - LED switch entities were not being created when no regular switches were configured
  - Removed early return in switch.py that prevented dimmer LED processing
  - LED switches now correctly created for all dimmers regardless of regular switch configuration

### Technical Details
- Updated `switch.py` async_setup_entry() to remove early return at line 66
- Function now processes dimmer configurations even when CONF_SWITCHES is empty
- Affects all dimmer/keypad entities with button LEDs

## [1.19.1] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- **Button Event Entities** - Fixed callback registration in event.py
  - Button event entities were failing with `TypeError: CrestronXsig.register_callback() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`
  - Changed from join-specific callback registration to global callback with join filtering
  - Matches pattern used in other platforms (light.py, switch.py, etc.)
  - Fixes button press, double press, and hold events for all dimmer/keypad entities

### Technical Details
- Updated `event.py` async_added_to_hass() to use `self._hub.register_callback(self.process_callback)`
- Added `process_callback(cbtype, value)` method that filters callbacks by checking against monitored joins
- Updated `async_will_remove_from_hass()` to use `self._hub.remove_callback()`
- Verified switch.py and select.py use correct callback patterns (no changes needed)

## [1.19.0] - 2025-01-19

    - Transport controls (play, pause, stop, next, previous)
  - Supports both YAML and UI configuration (dual config mode)
  - Automatic entity registry cleanup when removed
  - Hub persistence during reload (no connection drops)

### Changed
- **Media Player Platform** - Updated to support UI-based configuration
  - Dynamic feature detection based on configured joins
  - Unique ID prefix "ui_" for UI entities to prevent conflicts with YAML entities
  - Device class now configurable (tv, speaker, receiver)
  - Turn on/off support with optional power joins

## [1.18.0] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Modern Entity Naming** - Implemented Home Assistant's modern `has_entity_name = True` pattern for all dimmer entities
  - Home Assistant now automatically combines device name + entity name
  - Example: Device "Kitchen" + Entity "Button 1" = Friendly Name "Kitchen Button 1"
  - Aligns with Home Assistant best practices and future standards

### Changed
- **Event Entities** - Added `_attr_has_entity_name = True`, entity name now "Button 1" instead of "Kitchen Button 1"
- **Select Entities** - Added `_attr_has_entity_name = True`, entity name now "LED 1 Binding" instead of "Kitchen LED 1 Binding"
- **LED Switch Entities** - Added conditional `has_entity_name` property (True for LED switches), entity name now "LED 1" instead of "Kitchen LED 1"
- **Dimmer Light Entities** - Added conditional `has_entity_name` property (True for dimmer lights), entity name now "Light" instead of "Kitchen Light"

### Technical Details
- Event entities (`event.py`): Added `_attr_has_entity_name = True` class attribute
- Select entities (`select.py`): Added `_attr_has_entity_name = True` class attribute
- Switch entities (`switch.py`): Added `has_entity_name` property that returns True only for LED switches (dimmer-related)
- Light entities (`light.py`): Added `has_entity_name` property that returns True only for dimmer lights
- Regular standalone switches and lights remain unchanged (still use full names)
- Device name is set in `device_info.name` and Home Assistant handles the combination

### Benefits
- **Future-proof** - Matches mandatory pattern for new integrations per HA documentation
- **Automatic name updates** - When users rename a dimmer device, all entity names update automatically
- **Cleaner code** - No duplication of device name in entity names
- **Better organization** - Clear separation of device vs entity naming
- **HA ecosystem alignment** - Matches how modern integrations work (Z-Wave, Zigbee, etc.)

### Migration Notes
- **IMPORTANT**: After upgrading to v1.18.0, you MUST remove and re-add all dimmers for the new naming to take effect
- Existing entities will keep their old names until recreated
- Entity IDs should remain the same (unique_id format unchanged)
- Only dimmer-related entities are affected (events, selects, LED switches, dimmer lights)

## [1.17.7] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Entity Naming (Final Fix)** - Converted from attribute-based to property-based approach for event and select entities
  - Changed `_attr_name` to `name` property (matching switch.py pattern)
  - Changed `_attr_unique_id` to `unique_id` property
  - Changed `_attr_device_info` dict to `device_info` property returning DeviceInfo object
  - Event entities now correctly display as "{Dimmer Name} Button 1"
  - Select entities now correctly display as "{Dimmer Name} LED 1 Binding"

### Changed
- Added DeviceInfo import to event.py and select.py
- Converted from `_attr_` pattern to property methods
- Now matches the working implementation pattern from switch.py and light.py

## [1.17.6] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Entity Naming** - Removed `_attr_has_entity_name` approach and use full entity names directly
  - Event entities now correctly show "{Dimmer Name} Button 1"
  - Select entities now correctly show "{Dimmer Name} LED 1 Binding"
  - Matches the working approach used by switch and light entities

### Changed
- Removed `_attr_has_entity_name = True` from event.py and select.py
- Changed back to full entity names: f"{dimmer_name} Button {button_num}" and f"{dimmer_name} LED {button_num} Binding"
- Simpler, more consistent approach across all entity types
- No more reliance on HA's automatic device name prepending

## [1.17.5] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Entity Naming** - Fixed event and select entity names to work properly with Home Assistant's automatic device name prepending
  - Event entities now correctly display as "{Dimmer Name} Button 1" (was incorrectly duplicating name)
  - Select entities now correctly display as "{Dimmer Name} LED 1 Binding" (was incorrectly duplicating name)

### Technical Details
- Event and select entities have `_attr_has_entity_name = True`, which tells HA to auto-prepend device name
- Changed entity names from f"{dimmer_name} Button {button_num}" to f"Button {button_num}"
- Changed entity names from f"{dimmer_name} LED {button_num} Binding" to f"LED {button_num} Binding"
- HA automatically prepends device name (dimmer_name) when displaying
- Switch and light entities remain unchanged (they don't use _attr_has_entity_name)
- No impact on other platforms (covers, binary sensors, sensors, climate, media players)

## [1.17.4] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Entity Naming** - All dimmer entities now include dimmer name for better organization
  - Event entities: "{Dimmer Name} Button 1" instead of "Button 1"
  - Select entities: "{Dimmer Name} LED 1 Binding" instead of "LED 1 Binding"
  - Switch entities: Already correct - "{Dimmer Name} LED 1"
  - Light entities: Already correct - "{Dimmer Name} Light"

### Changed
- Updated `event.py`: Changed entity name from f"Button {button_num}" to f"{dimmer_name} Button {button_num}"
- Updated `select.py`: Changed entity name from f"LED {button_num} Binding" to f"{dimmer_name} LED {button_num} Binding"

## [1.17.3] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Dimmer Lighting Load** - Removed unnecessary digital on/off join; dimmers now use single analog join (0-65535) for both on/off and brightness control
- **Device Grouping** - Dimmer lighting load entities now properly grouped under dimmer device in Home Assistant

### Changed
- Lighting load configuration simplified - only requires brightness join (analog), no separate on/off join
- Light entities from dimmers use unique_id format: `crestron_light_dimmer_{name}_a{join}`
- Updated cleanup code to use brightness_join instead of obsolete is_on_join
- Updated UI strings and descriptions to reflect single analog join requirement
- Updated README with correct Crestron programming instructions (single analog join for dimmer control)

### Technical Details
- Light platform (`light.py`) now creates entities from dimmer configs with device grouping
- Config flow no longer asks for `light_on_join`, only `light_brightness_join`
- Dimmer lights automatically grouped under parent dimmer device
- Analog join range: 0 (off), 1-65535 (on with varying brightness)

## [1.17.2] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Dimmer Device Cleanup** - Device now properly removed from device registry when dimmer is deleted
- **Complete Entity Removal** - All entity types now removed when dimmer is deleted (events, selects, LED switches, light)
- Fixed issue where only light entity was removed, leaving orphaned event, select, and switch entities

### Changed
- Enhanced `_cleanup_dimmer_entities()` to remove all associated entity types:
  - Event entities (button press events)
  - Select entities (LED bindings)
  - Switch entities (LED switches)
  - Light entity (if lighting load present)
  - Device from device registry
- Cleanup now runs for ALL dimmers, not just those with lighting loads

## [1.17.1] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Manual Join Assignment Mode** - Choose between auto-sequential or manual join assignment
- Mode selector before dimmer configuration (auto-sequential recommended, manual for advanced users)
- Manual mode allows non-sequential join assignments (e.g., d10, d20, d30 instead of d10, d11, d12)
- Dynamic form that shows only relevant button join fields based on button count

### Changed
- Dimmer configuration now has 2-step process: 1) Select mode, 2) Configure joins
- Entity platforms (event.py, switch.py) now handle both auto-sequential and manual join modes

### Technical Details
- Added async_step_add_dimmer_mode() for mode selection
- Added async_step_add_dimmer_manual() for manual join configuration
- Dimmer config stores "manual_joins" dict for manual mode or "base_join" for auto mode
- Entity creation checks for manual_joins first, falls back to base_join calculation
- Form dynamically generates 3 fields per button (press, double, hold)

## [1.17.0] - 2025-11-18

### Added - Complete Dimmer/Keypad Redesign
- **Event Platform** - New platform for button press events (press, double_press, hold)

- **Real Entity Integration** - Creates event, switch, select, and light entities
- **LED Binding System** - Dropdown lists all HA entities, LED follows state automatically
- **Device Registry** - All entities grouped under single device

### Changed - Breaking Changes
- Simplified configuration from multi-step to single form (4 fields)
- Button actions configured via HA automations (not config flow)
- LED feedback configured via select dropdown (not config flow)
- Join assignment: 3 joins per button (press d10, double d11, hold d12)

### Removed
- v1.16.x dimmer configuration (multi-step wizard) - marked as deprecated

### Technical Details
- Event entities fire: event_type="crestron_button" with action: press/double_press/hold
- LED switches use press join for OUTPUT (bidirectional join usage)
- Select entities scan entity registry for bindable domains
- State mapping: 15+ domains, 30+ state mappings to LED on/off
- Sequential validation: base join + (button_count * 3 - 1) must be <= 250 (increased to 4096 in v1.20.7)

## [1.16.4] - 2025-11-18 [DEPRECATED]
